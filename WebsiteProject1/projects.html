                    and their scores are adjusted accordingly. After both players have had their turn, 
                    they are presented with the option to either continue the challenge or exit the game.

                    The chart is visually organized by assigning unique colors to each segment, 
                    corresponding to different educational activities like projects, quizzes, midterms, and final exams.
